# <a name="scenario"></a>Scenario
As a junior data scientist on the Zillow data science team, I am tasked to build a model that will predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses (using the property data from those whose last transaction was during May through August of 2017).

Unfortunately, some features of our dataset have been deleted. 
- I must also recover the following features:
    - the state and county information for all of the properties
    - distribution of tax rates for each county
        - tax amounts and tax value of the home

   
   
Memo from the Zillow Data Science Team:
>Note that this is separate from the model you will build, because if you use tax amount in your model, you would be using a future data point to predict a future data point, and that is cheating! In other words, for prediction purposes, we won't know tax amount until we know tax value.

### Goal:
The goal for this project is to create a model that will accurately predict a home's value determined by the county's Appraisal District. To do so, I will have to identify which of the various features available on Zillow's API affect the accuracy of my model's predictions the most. 

### Initial Hypotheses:

>$Hypothesis_{1}$
>
> There is a relationship between square footage and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{2}$
>
> There is a weak correlation between number of bathrooms and home value.

### Project Planning Initial Thoughts:
- With the missing features I am tasked to reproduce in mind, I want to create some (most likely) dummy features connecting `fips` to county names. 
    - I have a strong feeling that certain counties will have higher home value assessment. 
- On my second iteration, I'd also like to test the importance of 
    - `lotsizesquarefeet` 
    - `regionidcounty`
    - `regionidzip`
    - `regionidneighborhood`
    - `yardbuildingsqft17`
    - 'logerror'
- I'd like to create a new feature:
    - `home_age`: current year - `yearbuilt`
    - 
    
- Although to keep myself on track to reach my goals, I will first focus on my first iteration with my limited features of `calculatedfinishedsquarefeet`, `bedroomcnt` and `bathroomcnt` to predict my target `taxvaluedollarcnt`. 
- If time permits, I'd like to create nice visualizations in Tableau, although I may have to settle with seaborn graphics.

## Exploration Takeaways
After removing home_value outliers, it seems 'expensive/large' homes are still pulling my data towards the right. The median household looks like 1430 sqft, 3BD/2BA, with a value of $311_000.

Removal of my `home_value` outliers have put a damper on my correlations, most like due to the fact that I have so few features in this first iteration.

A majority of homes are in the bottom 25% of square feet and bottom 45% of home_value.

>$Hypothesis_{1}$
>
> $H_{0}$: There is a relationship between square footage and home value.
>
> $H_{a}$: There IS a correlation between square footage and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{2}$
>
> $H_{0}$: No correlation between number of bathrooms and home value.
>
> $H_{a}$: There IS a correlation between bathrooms and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{3}$
>
> $H_{0}$: No correlation between number of bedrooms and home value.
>
> $H_{a}$: There IS a correlation between bedrooms and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{4}$
>
> $H_{0}$: Three bedroom homes have the same value as the other homes.
>
> $H_{a}$: Home value for 3 bedroom homes differ from the rest.


>$Hypothesis_{5}$
>
> $H_{0}$: No correlation between the size of lot and home value.
>
> $H_{a}$: There IS a correlation between the size of lot and home value.


>$Hypothesis_{6}$
>
> $H_{0}$: No correlation between the year built and home value.
>
> $H_{a}$: There IS a correlation between the year built and home value.

Relevant features with **minimal** `nulls` matter! The more that is available, the more you are able to test and tweak your model to predict at better rates!
